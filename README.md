This is a primer on poverty and inequality measurement.


Scope
=====

Conceptually, simply defining poverty and inequality is nontrivial, so we will have
chapters on these.

In practice, the explosion of Big Data has primarily been about gathering voluminous
information about people with credit cards and a heavy consumption footprint. Measuring
the full scale of the population leans toward traditional survey techniques and using
that survey data to develop confidence about small area estimates. We will also cover the
literature on using sensor data to augment the survey data.

The primer will be at a graduate level. We will cover the basics, but do so in a manner
aimed at finding the points where there are still open questions. Readers are expected to
know basic Statistics and Economic theory. 

Format
======

This will be available as a PDF and as HTML. 

There will be a style guide on how to write the formatting shortly. We will not use
markdown.
