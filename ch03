Chapter(Small area estimation)

Here we cover modeling techniques for situations where there are subgroups within larger
groups, and we seek to describe the subgroups in greater detail. Typically there are only
a few observations on the subgroup.

The techniques here are sometimes described as `borrowing strength' from other
segments of the group to better describe a given subgroup. This is done in a somewhat
indirect manner: the error term in the model is described in much more detail than in
standard statistical models, and is decomposed into (subgroup error) = (group error) +
(subgroup-idiosyncratic error).

Section(Fay-Herriot)

The Fay-Herriot model Citep(fay:herriot) is attempts to structure errors in nested
manner, so the total error in an area is a combination of localized error and the
error from the containing group.

$$Y_a \sim {\cal N}(\theta_a, \sigma_a)$$
$$\theta_a \sim {\cal N}(x_a'\beta, \sigma_g)$$


If $\sigma_g$ were zero, then this would be a simple linear regression model, where the
outcome $Y_a = x_a'\beta + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim {\cal N}(0, \sigma_a)$.
