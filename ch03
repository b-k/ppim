Chapter(Small area estimation)

Here we cover modeling techniques for situations where there are subgroups within larger
groups, and we seek to describe the subgroups in greater detail. Typically there are only
a few observations on the subgroup.

The techniques here are sometimes described as `borrowing strength' from other
segments of the group to better describe a given subgroup. This is done in a somewhat
indirect manner: the error term in the model is described in much more detail than in
standard statistical models, and is decomposed into (subgroup error) = (group error) +
(subgroup-idiosyncratic error).

Section(Fay-Herriot)

The Fay-Herriot model Citep(fay:herriot) is attempts to structure errors in nested
manner, so the total error in an area is a combination of localized error and the
error from the containing group.

$$Y_a \sim {\cal N}(\theta_a, \sigma_a)$$
$$\theta_a \sim {\cal N}(x_a'\beta, \sigma_g)$$


If $\sigma_g$ were zero, then this would be a simple linear regression model, where the
outcome $Y_a = x_a'\beta + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim {\cal N}(0, \sigma_a)$.

Section(Elbers, Lanjouw, and Lanjouw)

Let $W_v$ be a statistic (a welfare indicator) to be calculated at the local (village)
level, and $\tilde\mu_v$ the caluclated estimate. Then Citet(elbers:lanjouw<> Elbers,
Lanjouw, and Lanjouw) break down the error into three parts:

$$W_v-\tilde\mu_v = (W_v-\mu_v) + (\mu_v - \hat\mu_v) + (\hat\mu_v - \tilde\mu_v)  $$

If each of these elements is consistent and well-behaved as $N\to\infty$, their
sum will be.


Paragraph(Idiosyncratic error: $W_v - \mu_v$) For statistics such as means,
the total deviation from the mean is the average of individual deviations. Let
$w(\cdot)$ be the single-household welfare calculation (its inputs will be
discussed below), and $N_v$ the count of households $h$ in a village, then

$$(W_v - \mu_v) = \frac{1}{N_v}\sum_{i=1}^{N_v} {w_i(\cdot) - \int_{\forall h} w(\cdot)}.$$
If there are survey weights, the equation can easily be modified accordingly.

Then 
$$\sqrt{N_v}(\mu_v - W_v} \to {\cal N}(0, \sigma),$$
where $\sigma$ is easily calculated.

the authors propose that most non-separable cases can be broken down into continuous
functions of means, and the above asymptotic properties apply to those means.


Paragraph(Model error: $\mu_v - \hat\mu_v$) The expected welfare estimator is the expected value of some function of 
a set of inputs, $\hat\mu = E[W|\dots]$. If we have consistent estimates of the
inputs and $W(\dots)$ is a continuous and differentiable function, then the
$\hat\mu_v$ is a consistent estimator of $\mu_v$, and $\sqrt{s}(\mu - \hat\mu)$
is Normally distributed (where $s$ is the number of units used in estimation).

The authors point out that if the $W(\dots)$ function is differentiable, then we
can use the delta method to convert the estimate of the variance of its inputs to a
variance of $W$.

Paragraph(Computation error: $\hat\mu_v - \tilde\mu_v$) Because the paper does estimations via
replication methods, one could get a bad estimate of the true statistic given
non-representative draws. The authors note that we are doing this exercise because we
have areas with a small number of observations, so it is not difficult to make enough
draws to cover the data.  We add that a decade has passed since the paper was written
and replications are still cheaper.

Subsection(Appropriate measures) To this point, we have a number of criteria
for a well-behaved system: $w(\cdot)$ should have the separability conditions
discussed above, and the welfare estimator $\hat\mu = E[W|\dots]$ should be
a continuous and differentiable function of inputs. The inputs to $W$ should be
consistently estimated as well.

The authors propose a number of variants of the Fay-Herriot model that fit this
form.
