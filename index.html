<h1>Small area estimation</h1><p></p>

<p>Here we cover modeling techniques for situations where there are subgroups within larger
groups, and we seek to describe the subgroups in greater detail. Typically there are only
a few observations on the subgroup.</p>

<p>The techniques here are sometimes described as `borrowing strength' from other
segments of the group to better describe a given subgroup. This is done in a somewhat
indirect manner: the error term in the model is described in much more detail than in
standard statistical models, and is decomposed into (subgroup error) = (group error) +
(subgroup-idiosyncratic error).</p>

<p><h2>Fay-Herriot</h2><p></p>

<p>The Fay-Herriot model (<a href="#fay:herriot">fay:herriot</a>) is attempts to structure errors in nested
manner, so the total error in an area is a combination of localized error and the
error from the containing group.</p>

<p>$$Y_a \sim {\cal N}(\theta_a, \sigma_a)$$
$$\theta_a \sim {\cal N}(x_a'\beta, \sigma_g)$$</p>

<p>If $\sigma_g$ were zero, then this would be a simple linear regression model, where the
outcome $Y_a = x_a'\beta + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim {\cal N}(0, \sigma_a)$.</p>

<p><h2>Elbers, Lanjouw, and Lanjouw</h2><p></p>

<p>Let $W_v$ be a statistic (a welfare indicator) to be calculated at the local (village)
level, and $\tilde\mu_v$ the caluclated estimate. Then <a href="#elbers:lanjouw">Elbers,
Lanjouw, and Lanjouw</a> break down the error into three parts:</p>

<p>$$W_v-\tilde\mu_v = (W_v-\mu_v) + (\mu_v - \hat\mu_v) + (\hat\mu_v - \tilde\mu_v)  $$</p>

<p>If each of these elements is consistent and well-behaved as $N\to\infty$, their
sum will be.</p>

<h6>Idiosyncratic error: $W_v - \mu_v$</h6><p> For statistics such as means,
the total deviation from the mean is the average of individual deviations. Let
$w(\cdot)$ be the single-household welfare calculation (its inputs will be
discussed below), and $N_v$ the count of households $h$ in a village, then</p>

<p>$$(W_v - \mu_v) = \frac{1}{N_v}\sum_{i=1}^{N_v} {w_i(\cdot) - \int_{\forall h} w(\cdot)}.$$
If there are survey weights, the equation can easily be modified accordingly.</p>

<p>Then 
$$\sqrt{N_v}(\mu_v - W_v) \to {\cal N}(0, \sigma),$$
where $\sigma$ is easily calculated.</p>

<p>the authors propose that most non-separable cases can be broken down into continuous
functions of means, and the above asymptotic properties apply to those means.</p>

<h6>Model error: $\mu_v - \hat\mu_v$</h6><p> The expected welfare estimator is the expected value of some function of 
a set of inputs, $\hat\mu = E[W|…]$. If we have consistent estimates of the
inputs and $W(…)$ is a continuous and differentiable function, then the
$\hat\mu_v$ is a consistent estimator of $\mu_v$, and $\sqrt{s}(\mu - \hat\mu)$
is Normally distributed (where $s$ is the number of units used in estimation).</p>

<p>The authors point out that if the $W(…)$ function is differentiable, then we
can use the delta method to convert the estimate of the variance of its inputs to a
variance of $W$.</p>

<h6>Computation error: $\hat\mu_v - \tilde\mu_v$</h6><p> Because the paper does estimations via
replication methods, one could get a bad estimate of the true statistic given
non-representative draws. The authors note that we are doing this exercise because we
have areas with a small number of observations, so it is not difficult to make enough
draws to cover the data.  We add that a decade has passed since the paper was written
and replications are still cheaper.</p>

<p><h3>Appropriate measures</h3><p> To this point, we have a number of criteria
for a well-behaved system: $w(\cdot)$ should have the separability conditions
discussed above, and the welfare estimator $\hat\mu = E[W|…]$ should be
a continuous and differentiable function of inputs. The inputs to $W$ should be
consistently estimated as well.</p>

<p>The authors propose a number of variants of the Fay-Herriot model that fit this
form.</p>
