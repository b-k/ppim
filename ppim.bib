 abstract = {An adaptation of the James-Stein estimator is applied to sample estimates of income for small places (i.e., population less than 1,000) from the 1970 Census of Population and Housing. The adaptation incorporates linear regression in the context of unequal variances. Evidence is presented that the resulting estimates have smaller average error than either the sample estimates or an alternate procedure of using county averages. The new estimates for these small places now form the basis for the Census Bureau's updated estimates of per capita income for the General Revenue Sharing Program.}
